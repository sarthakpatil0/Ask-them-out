# Ask-them-out
This JavaScript code implements a dynamic user interface with the following features:
1. A "Runaway" button that moves to random positions when hovered over or clicked.
2. A "Static" button that, when clicked, triggers the display of an image and hides both buttons.
3. Animated hearts are generated continuously after clicking the "Static" button.

- **Runaway Button**: Moves randomly on hover or click events.
- **Static Button**: Displays an image and triggers a heart animation.
- **Heart Animation**: Adds a playful visual effect to the website.
